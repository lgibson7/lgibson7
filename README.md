### Hey there! I'm Lydia (she/her). 👋🏾  

- I'm a second year M.S. Statistics student at Cal State East Bay in Hayward, CA; expected graduation May 2023. 👩🏾‍🎓

- I’m a former Intel data analytics graduate intern with interests in machine learning and data visualization. 📊

- I'm currently studying Advanced Statistical Theory, Advanced R for Data Science, Data Visualization, and Applied Research in Statistics and Biostatistics. 👩🏾‍🏫

- Fun fact: I've recently started my own blog, [*Once Upon a Time Series*](https://lgibson7.quarto.pub/once-upon-a-time-series/), and I love dancing Bachata. 💃🏾
