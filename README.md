## Hey there! I'm Lydia Gibson, and I'm open to work. :)

I'm a career changer, completing my Master of Science in Statistics from California State University East Bay in May 2023. From June 2023 to July 2024, I worked as a Data Scientist providing statistical support and expertise to process engineers in Intel‚Äôs leading developmental. As of September 2023, I‚Äôm also a board member of the Data Science Learning Community (formerly known as the R4DS Online Learning Community, find us at https://dslc.io/). When it comes to coding, my interests include exploring the intricacies of data visualization, mainly using the R programming language. Outside of my professional life, I'm passionate about bringing people together around common goals of shared learning in diverse and inclusive communities.

** posit::conf(2023) talk: How the R4DS Online Learning Community Made Me a Better Student**

- Posit Conference, September 20, 2023. Talk Track: Developing your skillset; building your career. Session Code: TALK-1110
- Through my participation in R4DS Online Learning Community, I have advanced my R and data science skills, making me a better student than I otherwise would have been through just my studies. As a non-traditional MS Statistics student with an undergraduate background in economics, I had absolutely no experience with the R programming language prior to pursuing my Master's degree. In July 2021, with hopes of getting a headstart on learning R before beginning my degree program, I joined the R4DS Slack Workspace. Along with helping to improve my programming skills, R4DS has connected me with scholarships, mentorship, and other opportunities, and I think that it would be beneficial for other students to know about this great resource.

**Practicality of Using Transformations in Multiple Linear Regression**

- Final Project for STAT 694 Applied Research in Statistics & Biostatistics, California State University East Bay, Fall 2022
- Compared the multiple linear regression (MLR) model with the inverse transformation dependent response variable to see how much prediction power is lost by not using a transformed response variable to fit a MLR model, and whether it is worth the inability to easily explain your model when using a transformed response variable.


**Gender Wage Inequality in STEM**

- Final Project for STAT 632 Linear and Logistic Regression, California State University East Bay, Spring 2022 
- Explored the data for STEM college majors to find associations that influence median wages and create a predictive model for median wages.
