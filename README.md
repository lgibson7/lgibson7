### Hey there! I'm Lydia (she/her). 👋🏾  

- I'm a second year M.S. Statistics student at Cal State East Bay in Hayward, CA, graduating in May 2023. 👩🏾‍🎓

- I'm very interested in exploring the intricacies of data visualization, mainly using the R programming language, but I'm also learning [Tableau](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/lydia.s.gibson). 👩🏾‍🏫

- Fun fact: I've recently started my own quarto-pub blog, [*Once Upon a Time Series*](https://lgibson7.quarto.pub/once-upon-a-time-series/).
