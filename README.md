## Hey there! I'm Lydia. 

I'm a recent MS Statistics graduate from California State University East Bay. My interests include exploring the intricacies of data visualization, mainly using the R programming language, but I'm also learning [Tableau](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/lydia.s.gibson).

**Practicality of Using Transformations in Multiple Linear Regression**

[*GitHub Repo*](https://github.com/lgibson7/Women-in-STEM) | [*Slide Presentation*](https://lgibson7.quarto.pub/women-in-stem) | [*Video Presentation*](https://youtu.be/2XkUYdLHsDA)
- Final Project for STAT 694 Applied Research in Statistics & Biostatistics, California State University East Bay, Fall 2022
- Compared the multiple linear regression (MLR) model with the inverse transformation dependent response variable to see how much prediction power is lost by not using a transformed response variable to fit a MLR model, and whether it is worth the inability to easily explain your model when using a transformed response variable.


**Gender Wage Inequality in STEM**

[*GitHub Repo*](https://github.com/lgibson7/Gender-Wage-Inequality-in-STEM) | [*Slide Presentation*](https://rpubs.com/lgibson7/stat632_final_presentaton) | [*Video Presentation*](https://youtu.be/ihl-15wL7zY)
- Final Project for STAT 632 Linear and Logistic Regression, California State University East Bay, Spring 2022 
- Explored the data for STEM college majors to find associations that influence median wages and create a predictive model for median wages.
