### Hey there! I'm Lydia (she/her). 

I'm a second-year Master's of Statistics student at California State University East Bay in Hayward, CA, graduating in May 2023. Following graduation, I'll be returning to Intel Inc., whom I interned for Summer 2022, as a Data Scientist. I'm currently studying Bootstrapping Methods and preparing for my MS comprehensive exam in April 2023 (wish me luck!). My interests include exploring the intricacies of data visualization, mainly using the R programming language, but I'm also learning [Tableau](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/lydia.s.gibson).
